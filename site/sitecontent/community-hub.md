# LibreCores Community Hub

What's going on in the Free and Open Silicon community? Where can I ask questions? How do I get involved?

## Community News
What's going on in the FOSSi community?

* [Planet LibreCores](/planet) aggregates blog articles from various voices around the community. Unfiltered and raw, but a great way to keep up with the community pulse.

## Getting Help
Everybody has questions. Let's find answers!

* LibreCores provides you with some documentation resources. It covers
  frequently asked questions, like "How do I publish my code?", or
  "Which license should I choose?". Have a look at our
  [documentation pages](docs) for an overview of available topics.
* You couldn't find the answer? Let's talk to real people!

  A good place to start is the discussion mailing list at 
  [discussion@lists.librecores.org](mailto:discussion@lists.librecores.org).
  You can subscribe to the mailing list in the 
  [web interface](https://lists.librecores.org/listinfo/discussion), which 
  also hosts the archives.

  Some questions are better suited for real-time chat. Most people use IRC for
  that, and you can find many people hanging out on the #fossi channel on freenode.
  You can connect either with a IRC client like [Hexchat](https://hexchat.github.io/),
  or use a [web interface](https://webchat.freenode.net/#fossi) to connect 
  directly from your browser.
